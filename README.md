# Plain Api

## What is this?

It's a basic http server written in ðŸ¦€. I'm making this to
practice and expand my knowledge of this fascinating language.
It is my way to get familiar with other programming paradigms beside OOP.
Finally, this project should serve a base for any and all
side-projects I may want to have. One thing that is on my mind
currently is building a simple but secure and reliable web-chat.
We'll see what else I'd want to experiment with.

## Project structure

* /chat - \*in progress\* has or will have it's own [README.md, here](/chat/README.md)
* /src
    * main.rs - init for utilities and start the server
    * config.rs - read env variables
    * server.rs - basic http server based on async TcpListener 
    * /api - routing and handlers for the incoming requests
        * response.rs - static http responses
        * /route - routing based on http headers
            * email.rs
            * user.rs

            * user.rs
            * auth.rs
        * /model - structs representing rows of appropriate tables
            * user.rs
            * auth.rs
