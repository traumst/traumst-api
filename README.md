# Plain Api

## What is this?

It's a basic http server written in ðŸ¦€. I'm making this to
practice and expand my knowledge of this fascinating language.
It is my way to get familiar with other programming paradigms beside OOP.
Finally, this project should serve a base for any and all
side-projects I may want to have. One thing that is on my mind
currently is building a simple but secure and reliable web-chat.
We'll see what else I'd want to experiment with.
